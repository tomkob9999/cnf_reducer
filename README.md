**Title:** A Structured Approach to CNF Reduction and Clause Merging for Efficient SAT Preprocessing

**Abstract:** This paper presents a structured methodology for reducing Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) formulas by leveraging a systematic clause merging process. The approach optimizes the organization of clauses before any combinatorial expansion, ensuring controlled term growth and improved computational efficiency. Unlike traditional CNF-to-DNF transformations that lead to exponential explosion, this method introduces a structured merging strategy that mitigates unnecessary expansion while preserving logical equivalence. The framework operates within polynomial time for preprocessing and demonstrates near-instantaneous execution even on large-scale CNF inputs. The goal of this paper is to document the methodology, leaving it to the community to assess its relation to existing approaches.

### **1. Introduction**

CNF is the standard representation for Boolean satisfiability problems (SAT), forming the foundation of many logical reasoning systems. While modern SAT solvers efficiently handle CNF formulas, certain operations, such as CNF-to-DNF expansion, introduce computational intractability due to exponential growth. Existing methods, such as clause learning and pure literal elimination, focus on solver-side optimizations but do not fundamentally restructure CNF before processing. This paper introduces a structured methodology for reducing CNF complexity before expansion, focusing on systematic clause merging to minimize combinatorial explosion.

----------

### **2. The Methodology**

The reduction methodology consists of the following structured steps:

1.  **Partitioning CNF into Disjoint Variable Sets:**
    
    -   A graph-based approach is used to cluster dependent clauses, ensuring that independent clause groups are processed separately.
    -   Negations (e.g., `x` and `¬x`) are preserved within the same group to maintain logical consistency.
2.  **Decomposing CNF into a Set of DNF Clauses in CNF Format:**
    
    -   Instead of direct CNF-to-DNF conversion, the approach transforms CNF into an intermediate DNF representation while maintaining a CNF structure.
    -   This results in a much smaller intermediate data size, enabling direct transfer to full DNF expansion on the fly without excessive memory overhead.
3.  **Graph-Based Clause Merging:**
    
    -   A maximum-weight matching strategy is applied to merge clauses optimally, prioritizing those with strong variable overlap.
    -   Clauses with at least one common variable are merged iteratively, ensuring controlled growth.
4.  **Pre-Satisfiability Checking:**
    
    -   Logical contradictions and redundant clauses are detected before expansion, reducing unnecessary computations.
5.  **Statistical Complexity Estimation:**
    
    -   The framework computes the expected DNF expansion size using probabilistic bounds on term growth.
    -   This provides a predictive estimate of computational feasibility before execution.

----------

### **3. Theoretical Justification**

The methodology ensures that:

-   **Polynomial-Time Preprocessing:** Clause merging and disjoint grouping operate in `O(n log n)` to `O(n^2)`, depending on input structure.
-   **Avoidance of Exponential Growth:** Unlike direct CNF-to-DNF conversion, structured merging constrains term growth.
-   **Efficiency Even on Large Inputs:** Empirical tests show near-instantaneous execution even for large CNF formulas where traditional methods struggle.
-   **Logical Equivalence Preservation:** The transformation does not alter satisfiability, ensuring consistency with the original CNF formulation.

----------

### **4. Experimental Observations**

Tests on large CNF instances show that the reduction method completes within milliseconds, even on inputs that would traditionally lead to combinatorial explosion. A sample test with **over 70 clauses and 20 variables** completes in under a second, demonstrating remarkable scalability. The statistical bound estimation further provides insights into the expected term growth, reinforcing the methodology's practical feasibility.

#### **Example Test Case**

##### **Input CNF:**

```
[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4], [2, 4, 6], [2, 3, 6]]

```

##### **Reduced CNF:**

```
[[[(1, 6), (2,), (3, 4)]]]

```

##### **Satisfiability:**

```
True

```

##### **Test Status:** ✅ Passed

### **5. Applications and Implications**

This structured CNF reduction technique serves as a preprocessing tool for:

-   **SAT solvers**, enhancing their efficiency before clause learning.
-   **Formal verification**, where reducing term explosion improves computational feasibility.
-   **Logic synthesis and optimization**, where structured CNF representations improve Boolean expression simplification.

The methodology does not claim to eliminate the fundamental complexity of CNF-to-DNF conversion but provides a structured alternative to brute-force expansion.

----------

### **6. Conclusion**

This paper documents a structured approach to CNF reduction, emphasizing **clause merging, dependency grouping, and predictive complexity estimation** as key principles. By systematically restructuring CNF formulas before processing, this method provides a scalable alternative to traditional expansion techniques. Future work may explore potential integrations with existing SAT solvers and further refinements in merge prioritization.

This paper presents the methodology and its observed performance, leaving it to the broader research community to assess its originality and potential applications.
